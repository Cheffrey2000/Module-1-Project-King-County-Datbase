    "We are attempting to help realtors select profitable properties for their clients such as:\n",
    "* New home buyers\n",
    "* Families Relocating\n",

    "The dataset consists of home sales from May 2014 through May 2015.  \n",
    "The information provided for each home consists of the following categories:  \n",
    "- **Price** - This is our target  \n",
    "- **ID** - This is a unique identifier for each House in the dataset  \n",
    "- **Date** - This is the date of sale  \n",
    "- **Bedrooms** - This is the number of bedrooms in the house  \n",
    "- **Bathrooms** - This is the number of bathrooms in the house  \n",
    "- **Sqft_living** - This is the number of square feet in the living space  \n",
    "- **Sqft_lot** - This is the number of square feet in the total lot area  \n",
    "- **Floors** - This is the number of levels in the house  \n",
    "- **Waterfront** - This denotes whether or not the property is on the water  \n",
    "- **View** - This identifies how many times the house was viewed  \n",
    "- **Condition** - This tells the condition of the house from 1 (worn out) to 5 (excellent)  \n",
    "- **Grade** - The grade of the house based on the King County grading system of 1(poor) to 13(excellent)  \n",
    "- **Sqft_above** - Total square feet without basement  \n",
    "- **Sqft_basement** - Square footage of the basement alone  \n",
    "- **Yr_built** - The year the house was originally built  \n",
    "- **Yr_renovated** - The year the house was renovated if it has been  \n",
    "- **Zipcode** - The zip code of the house  \n",
    "- **Lat** - The latitude location of the house  \n",
    "- **Long** - The longitude location of the house  \n",
    "- **Sqft_living15** - The square footage of the home in the year 2015  \n",
    "- **Sqft_lot15** - The square footage of the lot in 2015  \n"

    "Here is a summary of our observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __*id*__ is simply an identifier<br>\n",
    "    This will be removed as it is not pertinent to the data analysis.<br>\n",
    "- __*date*__ is a string.<br>\n",
    "    Our initial impression is that it reflects sale dates for the property.<br>\n",
    "    This should be converted to a numerical value for processing.<br>\n",
    "- There are two columns related to the size, __*sqft_living and sqft_lot*__ <br>\n",
    "    We will explore their relationship and determine if they are dependent on each other or not<br>\n",
    "- __*floors*__ is a numerical value.<br>\n",
    "    Based on our knowledge of houses we believe this may be better suited to a categorical value.<br>\n",
    "    We will explore the data and convert it to either a single or multiple<br> \n",
    "    or decide if each value of floors needs it's own category.<br>\n",
    "- __*waterfront*__ is definitely categorical sine a home can only be either on or off the water.<br>\n",
    "    We will convert this to a binary value to represent either on or off the water.<br>\n",
    "- __*sqft_basement*__ <br>\n",
    "    This along with __*sqft_above*__ combined are the same as __*sqft_living*__ so we will deal with it<br>\n",
    "    since the presence of a basement is more significant than the size.<br>\n",
    "    'sqft_basement will then be converted to categories which will identify the presence of a basement<br>\n",
    "- __*zipcode*__ and __*lat*__ and __*long*__ are both location data.<br>\n",
    "    We will determine if all are necessary and treat them accordingly<br>\n",
    "- __*yr_renovated*__ has many null values so they will be used to create a new feature.<br>\n",
    "    we will subtract it from the last date in the database and create __*ren_period*__"
